/**
 * Based on code from Sparkfun by LeRoy Miller (c) 2018
 * https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2161
 * 
 * This code works kind of opposite of what you might expect.
 * PIN 3 is used on the LED Matrix, When a flash light or bright light
 * is shown on this PIN, the pin goes low (or lower), and the robot moves
 * forward.  It will stop when the light is removed. 
 * It's slow to react. but it does work.

 * SparkFun Inventor's Kit Project
 * LED as Light Sensor
 * Date: July 8, 2016
 * 
 * Description:
 *  Demonstration of how to use an LED as a light sensors. Cover 
 *  up the LED plugged into pin 2/3 to light up the output LED
 *  plugged into pin 9. Note that you might have to change the
 *  THRESHOLD parameter. Connect a Serial terminal to get raw
 *  readings of the light value.
